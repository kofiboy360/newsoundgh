  Honestly, I don’t know what this journey would make out of me, I’m still
  figuring it out. I write stories about my past and my emotions get the best of
  me, every time. I enjoy putting stories together and to have listening ears,
  but however it goes I keep it honest and from my heart. I am not very sociable
  with large groups of people but I do have a few friends I like to spend
  intimate times with. I couldn’t dance attendance on anyone, people like what
  they like.


  I am open to fall in love with the next beautiful thing. I go all out into whatever I venture into, be it Places, Art, Human, Ideas or whatever form it takes.. sometimes losing myself in the process. One of these Trips is what birthed my new project "Arrrggghhhhh!" an extended play about my experience with drugs, sex and a need to belong. This piece of art is yours from the bottom of my heart... Truly.
