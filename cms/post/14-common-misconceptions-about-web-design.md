f_post-summary: However you choose to define your niche, lean into it fully
  through your visuals, lyricism, collaborators, and overall branding.
  Consistency breeds familiarity, and familiarity breeds ardent fandom over
  time. Don't be afraid to get niche - your singular artistic voice is what will
  make you unforgettable in a crowded music landscape.
